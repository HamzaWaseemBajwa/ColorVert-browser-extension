Important
------------

- If the website already uses a filter in its css, the elements might change their original location when applying Colorblinding. To get them back, just select the option <b>deactivate</b> and refresh the page if it doesn't do it by itself.
- Colorblinding works in all tabs and the filter is applied when the tab is <b>fully loaded<b>.
